In an effort to organize some of my past projects and in anticipation of future coding projects I have uploaded a lot of files into the portfolio repository. This isn't all that I have created in the past but is a rather good representation. Within are multiple works in progress and final copys of digital and physical files. 

Bear in mind that the majority were created in a learning or trial mindset and thus may not be as well made as later files. 

Beware the original website page because - at this moment - the incorrect file is connected. It looks even worse than it actually is and it hurts my soul.

I plan to start new projects directly in GitHub to better showcase the creative process while making them. To show my work as my high school math teacher would say.  Hope you find my past enlightning if you choose to peruse it.

See ya soon!
