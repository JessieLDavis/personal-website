## Fandom Matters in the Workplace

So my brother and friends are trying to get me to watch Rick and Morty and - while I am not opposed to it - I haven't gotten around to it yet. 

However this gaping lack of knowledge apparently does not stop me from accidentally making referencial works.

I made this on my own just wanting to play around with opacity in the Sticknodes Pro app on the iPad. I just thought blue was a collor that would be pleasing to the eye.

Everyone I've shown it to goes "Ah its Mr. Meeseeks!"

I guess its a good thing? I'll find out once I actually catch up I guess.

See ya soon:)
