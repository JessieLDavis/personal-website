## About


Greetings and salutations visitor!

I am a developing UI/UX engineer. With a number of art studio credits to guide me, I work on making small animations and designs in Photoshop and Adobe knock-offs. Most of my work is for personal practice but I have designed app iconography for in-production and released apps. At the moment I am delving more into the coding aspect in order to get a better understanding of the world I plan to work in and to have more creative avenues for development.

In my free time I play a lot of video games and read. Also I sing to most songs in my vicinity and have a deep love for Disney and its Animation studios. My dream is to work in developing VR cinematography and I am always excited to see the new tech on the horizon. There is so many ways to explore and I am just happy to be an adventurer.

Keep in mind I am very new to this but hopefully my blogging benefits someone. 

See ya soon!
